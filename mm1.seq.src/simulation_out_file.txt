Two successive Single-server queueing systems

Mean interarrival time      1.000 minutes

Mean service1 time           0.700 minutes

Max travel time time      2.000 minutes

Mean service2 time           0.900 minutes

Total Simulation Time     1000.00



Averay delay in queue1 = 1.552 minutes

Average number in queue1 = 1.846

Server1 utilization = 0.770

Averay delay in queue2 = 2.089 minutes

Average number in queue2 = 2.060

Server2 utilization = 0.712

Time simulation ended = 1000.508 minutes
